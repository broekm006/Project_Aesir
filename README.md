"Companion app" > Fitness

__Problem statement:__
Everyday people go fitness at their local gym, and lift weight / run for miles to improve, but no gym has a way to show the progress is being made. Because the current fitness apps dont support this function and are lacking in allot of departments. It is time to make an application that can show progress and allow you to enter your own data. Target Audiance: People that fitness and want a way to see their progress.

__Description:__
An application that gives insight to the daily/weekly routine that is fitness. In this application you can find all the details for which exercises are available, enter your own sets/reps and weights, create your own routine and check the results of the hard work.
